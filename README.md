Click on the [Try the CICS TXeries Beta (Windows, Linux, AIX)](https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmcom/txseries/) link - this will take you to instructions for creating a docker image running a local TXSeries server.

## Up and Running

You will need the current version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed and running on your laptop/workstation, and an active internet connection.

The following command will 
+ create a docker container from ubuntu
+ install the TXSeries current beta 
+ configure the TXSeries default instance and activate the server
+ expose the web-admin port and the terminal server port (3270 emulator required for access)

```
docker run -it -p 3270:3270 -p 9443:9443 -h TXSERIES -e LICENSE=accept ibmcom/txseries
```
### Installation Verification Program (IVP)
Connect to a terminal seession with x3270, [IBM Personal Communications](https://www.ibm.com/uk-en/marketplace/personal-communications), [tn3270 X for mac](https://www.brown.edu/cis/tn3270/index.html#latest),or similar host terminal emulator

Configure a terminal session with your emulator to connect to your localhost/loopback address on port 3270
```
tn3270 localhost:3270
```
This will bring up an empty 3270 terminal sesssion; to validate that the system is alive and well, enter `MENU` as the first transaction name
